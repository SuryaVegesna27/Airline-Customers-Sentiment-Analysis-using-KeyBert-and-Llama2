# **Airline Customer Experience Analysis**  

## **Project Overview**  
This project analyzes airline customer experiences by leveraging **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning (ML)**. It extracts insights from customer reviews and numerical ratings to uncover patterns, detect sentiments, and identify critical factors affecting customer satisfaction or dissatisfaction.  

---

## **Purpose**  
With millions of online reviews, airlines need to understand passenger sentiments to improve their services. This project aims to:
- **Extract and analyze customer reviews** to identify major complaints and praises.
- **Perform sentiment analysis** to classify reviews as positive, negative, or neutral.
- **Implement topic modeling** to detect key themes such as food quality, staff behavior, and seating comfort.
- **Build a recommendation system** using machine learning models to predict customer satisfaction.  
- **Provide actionable insights** for airlines to enhance their services.

## **Project Workflow**  

### **Step 1: Web Scraping Airline Reviews**  
- Uses `BeautifulSoup` and `requests` to scrape airline reviews from airlinequality.com.  
- Extracts:
  - **Airline name**
  - **Review title**
  - **Review text**
  - **Overall rating**
  - **Service ratings (e.g., cabin staff, inflight entertainment, seat comfort)**  
- Saves structured data into a CSV file for further analysis.  

### **Step 2: Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**  
- Handles missing values and incorrect data entries.  
- Tokenizes and normalizes review text using `nltk`.  
- Removes stopwords and applies **lemmatization** for better analysis.  

### **Step 3: Sentiment Analysis**  
- **Lexicon-Based Sentiment Analysis**:  
  - Uses `NLTK VADER` to classify reviews into **positive, negative, or neutral**.  
- **ChatGPT-3.5 Sentiment Categorization**:  
  - Uses OpenAIâ€™s GPT model for advanced sentiment classification and topic extraction.  

### **Step 4: Topic Modeling**  
- **KeyBERT** extracts the main topics from reviews.  
- **LLama2** identifies patterns and clusters similar reviews.  
- Visualizes insights using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`.  

### **Step 5: Recommendation System (Machine Learning Model)**  
- Predicts whether a customer would **recommend an airline** based on their ratings and review sentiment.  
- Models Used:
  - **Logistic Regression**
  - **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
  - **Decision Trees**
  - **Random Forest**  
- Evaluates models using:
  - **Accuracy**
  - **Precision**
  - **Recall**
  - **F1-score**

## **Results & Insights**  

### **Key Findings**  
- **Sentiment Analysis Results**:
  - **Negative reviews** often focus on **delays, baggage handling, and customer service.**  
  - **Positive reviews** highlight **in-flight experience, staff friendliness, and business class seating.**  
- **Topic Modeling Insights**:
  - Frequent topics include **WiFi connectivity, legroom space, and meal quality.**  
- **Machine Learning Model Performance**:
  - **Logistic Regression achieved the highest accuracy** for predicting customer recommendations.  
  - **Decision Trees** performed well in capturing nuanced sentiments.
